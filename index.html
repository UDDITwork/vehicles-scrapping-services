        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the end of the road, where every car, truck, scooty, and bus comes for its final curtain call – but fear not! Here at Scrap My Ride, we believe in reincarnation; not in the spiritual sense, but in turning what was once your trusty vehicle into the raw materials for tomorrow's innovations.
               <hr>
            <h2>Our Philosophy: More Than Just Scrap</h2>
            
            In the grand tradition of human endeavor to recycle and reuse, we've taken content theory to heart, not just in how we present ourselves, but in our core operations. You see, motivation is key – not just for humans but for vehicles too. They've been motivated by petrol, diesel, or perhaps the spark of electricity, to carry you across cities, countries, or just down to the local shop. Now, we motivate their parts towards a new life.
            <hr>
           <h2>The Hierarchy of Vehicle Needs</h2>
            
            <h3>Survival Needs</h3><br> Just like Maslow's base level, every vehicle starts here – needing basic maintenance. But when maintenance costs climb higher than a giraffe's eye, it's time for the next stage.
            <h3>Safety Needs:</h3><br> We ensure every vehicle is stripped safely, no hazardous spill left behind, protecting both human and Mother Earth.
            <h3>Belonging:</h3> <br>Your vehicle has belonged to roads, to cities, and to you. Here, it belongs to a process where every part finds a new home.
            <h3>Esteem:</h3><br> Here, vehicles achieve their highest honor – being recognized not for their brand or speed, but for their contribution to sustainability.
            <h3>Self-Actualization:</h3><br> In our world, this is when your old vehicle's parts achieve their full potential in new forms, from skyscraper beams to trendy recycled art.
            <hr>

        <p><h2 class="Jinda">The Vehicle Scrapping Policy in India:</h2>
            <h2>Why Scrapping?:</h2>
            Environmental: To reduce the number of polluting vehicles. Think of it as Earth's lungs getting a bit of relief.
            Economic: It's like giving the automobile industry a new lease on life. More scrapping = more buying = more selling = more money flowing.
            <hr>
            <h2>Key Points from the Policy:</h2>
            
            Fitness First: Vehicles must undergo a fitness test. If they fail, they're encouraged (read: gently nudged) towards scrapping. This is like a cosmic health check for your car, where failure doesn't just mean a diet, but retirement.
            Incentives:
            Tax Breaks: Get a discount on new vehicle registration or road tax if you scrap the old one. It's like a cosmic reward system for saying goodbye to your vehicular companion.
            Cash for Clunkers: You might get a percentage of the vehicle's value if you choose to scrap. Not quite as dramatic as a spaceship trade-in, but it helps.
            Compulsory Scrapping: 
            Personal vehicles over 15 years and commercial ones over 10 years might face de-registration if they don't pass fitness tests. This is like mandatory retirement, but for vehicles.
           <hr>
            <h2>Scrapping Process:</h2>
            Fitness Test: At Automated Testing Stations, which sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie but is just a fancy place to check if your car is roadworthy.
            Scrap Yards: If your vehicle fails or you choose to scrap, it goes to a scrapping facility. Think of it as a retirement home for vehicles, but with less bingo and more metal crunching.
            Green Tax: Vehicles over 8 years might face additional taxes, encouraging owners to either maintain their vehicle's fitness or scrap it. It's like a cosmic fine for not keeping your spaceship in good shape.
            Implementation: 
            The policy has been rolled out with various notifications, aiming to phase out old vehicles systematically. It's like a slow, bureaucratic dance towards a greener planet.</p>
